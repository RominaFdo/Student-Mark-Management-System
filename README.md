# Student Mark Management System
This program manages student marks for two streams: Biology and Mathematics. It calculates class and school ranks based on entered marks and stores the data in a text file.

## Features

* **Biology Stream:** Calculates and saves marks for Biology, Physics, and Chemistry subjects.
* **Mathematics Stream:** Calculates and saves marks for Combined Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry subjects.
* **Rank Calculation:** Computes class ranks and school ranks based on average marks.
* **Data Storage:** Stores student information and marks in a text file (`StuData.txt`).

## Usage

**1.Biology Stream:**

* Enter marks for Biology, Physics, and Chemistry subjects for each student in classes A, B, and C.
* Calculate and display class ranks for each class.
* Calculate and display overall school ranks based on average marks.

**2.Mathematics Stream:**

* Enter marks for Combined Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry subjects for each student in classes A, B, C, D, and E.
* Calculate and display class ranks for each class.
* Calculate and display overall school ranks based on average marks.

**3.File Management:**

* Data is stored in `StuData.txt`.
* Each class's data is appended under its respective section.

## File Structure
* **`main.cpp`:** Main program file containing stream classes and main function.
* **`StuData.txt`:** Text file for storing student information and marks.

## Usage Instructions
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow on-screen instructions to enter student names and marks.
4. View class and school ranks generated by the program.

## Notes
* Ensure the `StuData.txt` file path is correct and accessible for data storage.
* Modify file paths and class names as per your environment and requirements.
